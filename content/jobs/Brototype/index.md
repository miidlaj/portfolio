- An intensive training program that spanned over 8 months.
- This comprehensive program involved self-learning and hands-on experience through two live projects. Additionally, we had the privilege of receiving weekly reviews and guidance from industry experts, which allowed us to continually refine our skills and knowledge.
- One aspect that sets my training program apart is its rigorous nature, as evidenced by the completion rate of only 40-50% among participants.
- Completed several projects including two live projects from scratch to production.
